# CmPortfolio
My Portfolio Page for Github Pages Portfolio Assignment.

This is the final assignment from the Fullstack Development with MERN bootcamp via MITxPRO for section one. This app is a reflection of my understanding and knowledge of  section one as exhibited by the functioning web Page. 

How to run: 
Open the page, click the links, and scroll!


This website has the following:
a Navbar which was sourced from Bootstrap which directs to the detailed sections of the web page.
Animate on Scroll which was sourced from Github.com/michalsnik.
The latter allows for text and other objects to be animated and come in from left, right, up, or down. All set with A.O.S delay timers via java-script.
Youtube Video hosted by youtube.
Styled buttons to contact me via github, instagram, linkedin & email
Styled links to check out my portfolio and other work

Stylesheet from cloudflare

Google Fonts cdn stylesheet
Font Awesome cdn.
Autotype sourced from github.com/mattboldt/typed.js

 
Road-map of future improvements:
I would like to figure out how to embed another image on the left hand side of the homepage.
I would like to have a better understanding of youtube video embedding and styling.
I would like to make the page more interactive.
I would love to make the Navbar have a fixed position so it stays in place as you scroll.
Stay tuned for future improvements.
